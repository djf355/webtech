				<h2>Exam Season Round 2...</h2>
				<div class="date">
				15 May, 2017
				</div>
			</header>
			<p>First, this exam period is definitely better than the last one. To begin, I
			only have two exams and a wonderful web project that I really enjoy working on
			and have spent a lot of time perfecting and really hope that my instructor notices
			just how much I really love this website. :) Also, as previously stated in the
			Winter exam post, there was no period of time where I had the chance to forget
			all of the material that I had been working on.

			<h2>Start of "Date Night"...</h2>
			<div class="date">
			5 March, 2017
			</div>
			<p>My boyfriend and I have instituted date night. Oh, yes. We are picking a date,
			once every few weeks, to spend romantic time together. #cantstopwontstop. Whether
			it's the movies, a nice dinner, a nice dinner and the movies, whatever, it's
			gonna happen. And it's going to be great. Was it my idea? Surprisingly, no. But,
			did he feel like he had no other choice? Surprisingly, not surprisingly yes. Yes,
			he did. Whatever, I'll take what I can get.

			<h2>Birthday Time</h2>
			<div class="date">
			1 February, 2017
			</div>
			<p>My birthday is tomorrow. Am I the person that plans every second of their
			birthday down to the times I pee? No. Definitely not. I have no plans, and I
			don't enjoy all of the extra attention. I don't know what my plans are, but I'm
			hoping some chocolate is involved at some point. I'm turning 22, but I feel like
			#feelin22 is too old to use. Everyone else got the chance to do it, and it was
			super cute with their Instagram posts, but like it's cool. I'll find another 
			hashtag. #bein22 or something like that. Maybe I'll write my own song.

			<h2>Exam Season...</h2>
			<div class="date">
			4 January, 2017
			</div>
			<p> So, another difference between schools in the states and schools here in
			the U.K. are exam times. Maybe some schools do it back across the pond as well,
			who knows? Not me. Anyway, here the exams are taken in January, aka post winter-
			break, aka post all that time you spent forgetting every single thing that you
			learned in the previous term, aka that time when your stress levels weren't so
			high and now they're through the roof very much because of forgetting every single
			thing you learned the previous term.

			<h2>Where Has the Sun Gone?</h2>
			<div class="date">
			14 October, 2016
			</div>
			<p>If I were in Florida, right now, it would be 28 degrees outside, sunny. Currently,
			in Bristol, it's 13 degrees outside. 13. Less than half of the temperature in
			Florida. Less. Than. Half. I'm a Fahrenheit girl, though, so tbh these numbers
			mean nothing to me, but I wanted to be more #accessible for everyone. Basically,
			my question, and the question that has been plaguing me ever since my overseas
			adventure began...where has the sun gone?

			<h2>Becoming an Adult...</h2>
			<div class="date">
			4 August, 2016
			</div>
			<p> TL;DR still not an adult.</p>
			<p>
			I graduated from NYU in May, and I've been slumming
			it with my parents ever since. The grad school process was a bit complicated, as
			I was determined to go to school overseas, where they fully accept you only after
			seeing your final transcript. Which meant I needed my exam grades. Which meant
			the professors needed to grade the exams... which they were doing... very...
			very... sloooowly.... Anyway, grades went up and then there was this whole debacle
			with, even though my final transcript was done, some schools wanted my certificate.
			Which, as with most schools in the US of A, does not come until 3 months after
			you graduate. Makes total sense. Anyway, through all of that nonsense in the beginning,
			I just waited around. Finally, things were set with University of Bristol, so that
			is where I will be headed in September.
			</p>
			<p>
			Funnily enough, that's where my long-distance boyfriend is currently going
			to school. No, I did not plan my life around around him. Things actually just
			worked out really well. I applied to the University of Bristol just to see if I
			could get in, but set my sights elsewhere. In the end, it was the best university
			that I was accepted to, so that made my decision. So, here I go.
